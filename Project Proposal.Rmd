### Introduction

For our project, we are interested in understanding how we can predict the annual number of visitors to a library by examining the effects of a wide range of predictors, such as the size of the physical and digital collection, programs offered and their geographic locations in proximity to urban areas. 

##Literature Summary

##Data Description

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# loading and cleaning data 
library(tidyverse)
rawdata <- read.csv(file ="PLS_FY23_AE_pud23i.csv")
# extract relevant predictors
rawdata1 <- subset(as.data.frame(rawdata), select = c(VISITS, LIBNAME, HRS_OPEN, TOTSTAFF, TOTPHYS, EBOOK, TOTPRO, TOTATTEN, STAFFEXP, TOTEXPCO, TOTOPEXP, POPU_LSA, WEBVISIT, GPTERMS, LOCALE_MOD))
