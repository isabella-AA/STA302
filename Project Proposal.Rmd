# Introduction

For our project, we are interested in understanding how we can predict the annual number of visitors to a library by examining the effects of a wide range of predictors, such as the size of the physical and digital collection, programs offered and their geographic locations in proximity to urban areas. 

## Literature Summary

# Data Description

The dataset was obtained from the Public Libraries Survey (PLS) 2023, conducted annually by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) in the United States. The PLS was originally designed to provide standardized national data on public library operations, such as visits, staffing, and expenditures, to support policy and service improvement. Data is collected through an annual national census survey of public libraries, self-reported by each library and verified by state data coordinators via a centralized web-based system.

After merging categorical location codes and removing missing values, the final dataset includes 5,110 observations, 12 numerical predictors, and one categorical variable, LOCALE_GROUP, indicating the library’s location type  (Urban, Suburban, Town, Rural). The response variable, VISITS, measures annual physical library visits. As a continuous, non-negative variable roughly proportional to library scale, VISITS is suitable for linear regression analysis.

Table 1 provides a numerical summary of all continuous predictors and response variable. Most numerical variables exhibit large ranges and standard deviations, suggesting substantial variation and the presence of outliers. In several variables, the mean exceeds the median, confirming right-skewness.
```{r table1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

cont_vars <- c("HRS_OPEN","TOTSTAFF","TOTPHYS","EBOOK","TOTPRO",
               "TOTATTEN","STAFFEXP","TOTEXPCO",
               "POPU_LSA","WEBVISIT","GPTERMS","VISITS")

sum_table <- clean_data %>%
  select(all_of(cont_vars)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Variables", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(Variables) %>%
  summarise(
    Min = round(min(value, na.rm = TRUE),0),
    Max = round(max(value, na.rm = TRUE),0),
    Mean= round(mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), 0),
    `Interquartile Range` = round(IQR(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    Median = median(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Standard deviation` = round(sd(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Variables = recode(Variables,
      "HRS_OPEN"  = "Total Annual Hours Open",
      "TOTSTAFF"  = "Full-time Staff",
      "TOTPHYS"   = "Total Physical Collection Size",
      "EBOOK"     = "Ebooks",
      "TOTPRO"    = "# of Synchronous Programs",
      "TOTATTEN"  = "# Attendance at Synchronous Programs",
      "STAFFEXP"  = "Staff Expenditure",
      "TOTEXPCO"  = "Collection Expenditures",
      "POPU_LSA"  = "Population Served",
      "WEBVISIT"  = "Website Visits",
      "GPTERMS"   = "# of Computers Available",
      "VISITS"    = "Total Visits"
    )
  )

kable(sum_table, caption = "Numerical summaries of the location and spread of the data")
``` 

Figure 1 shows the distribution of VISITS, which is highly right-skewed, indicating that most libraries have moderate visitor counts while a few receive extremely high visits.
```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of VISITS", fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
hist(clean_data$VISITS[clean_data$VISITS], breaks = 50,
     main = "Distribution of VISITS", xlab = "Number of Visits",
     col = "skyblue", border = "white")
```

Figure 2 compares VISITS across location types, where Urban libraries have the highest medians and greatest variability, while Town and Rural libraries show lower and more consistent levels. This supports including LOCALE_GROUP  as a categorical predictor in the regression.

Figure 3 presents the relationship between TOTPRO and VISITS by locale.The positive slopes across all groups indicate that offering more programs increases visits, with steeper slopes for Urban and Suburban libraries. This suggests an interaction effect between program and location, which will be incorporated into the preliminary regression model.
```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visits by Location Type", fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
boxplot(VISITS ~ LOCALE_GROUP, data = clean_data,
        main = "Visits by Location Type",
        xlab = "Locale", ylab = "Number of Visits",
        col = "lightblue")
```

```{r fig3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Programs vs. Visits by Locale (<20k Programs)", fig.width=6, fig.height=4,fig.align='center',message = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
ggplot(clean_data[clean_data$TOTPRO < 20000, ], aes(x = TOTPRO, y = VISITS, color = LOCALE_GROUP)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Programs Offered", y = "Visits", color = "Locale") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)+
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.8, 0.8),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = alpha('white', 0.6), color = NA),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  )
```
